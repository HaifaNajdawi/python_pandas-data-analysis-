## Written Observable Trends in the Data

#### % Overall Passing
1.  The `Charter` schools have the highest percentage of students who are passing classes. On the other hand, the lowest performing schools are the `District` school. However, both of these types of schools paid about the same per student.

#### % Passing Math
2. We have separated each school's math scores by 9th graders, 10th graders, 11th graders, and 12th graders. Although the average scores of each school are different, the grade-level-specific categories are approximately the same for a single school. For example, Bailey High School's...

* 9th graders --> 81%
* 10th graders -> 80%
* 11th graders -> 80%
* 12th graders -> 80%

#### % Passing Reading
3. `Average Reading` Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school have mostly the same scores and its more than `Math` scores. 

#### School Budgets per Student
4. `School paid less` on average for each student they has `higher score` rather than school paid for each student more ( i.e. the budget per student was `less than $585` but the `overall score 90.37` in other hand buget per student is `almost $680` but the `overall score is 53.53` ! ).

#### Number of Students per School
5. `Schools` have a `larg size`between 2000-5000 there students has `a lowest overall scores` !. 






## Description observable trends based on the data

1.  The top 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing was for `Charter` school, in other hand the bottom performing schools on % overall passing for `District`, although both of these type of school paid almost equal for each student.

2. `Average Math` Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school mostly equal scores, so that give us hint : 

  *  All the schools in these grades average student score between (77-84).
  *  Each school there students have almost the same average in all grades. 
3. `Average Reading` Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school mostly equal scores and its more than `Math` scores. 

4. `School paid less` on average for each student they has `higher score` rather than school paid for each student more ( i.e. the budget per student was `less than $585` but the `overall score 90.37` in other hand buget per student is `almost $680` but the `overall score is 53.53` ! ).

5. `Schools` have a `larg size`between 2000-5000 there students has `a lowest overall scores` !.
